This is a Silver > Gold rank predictor for the War Robots Content Creator program, this predictor is designed to help Silver ranked players to estimate, 
not 100% accurately, on when they could possibly reach Gold rank, this predictor is completely thought of, and community-made by me, 1 person, in the program, 
and this predictor has NOTHING to do with Pixonic, or MY.GAMES, and this predictor is based off of patterns previously, meaning it will never be 100% accurate but it will predict, 
errors are possible but are getting hammered shortly after I notice them, as I made this entirely using VS (Visual Studio) Code.

This predictor gets updated each time within a few days when a change is then made, and a new commit (updated change) happens, please refer to the absolute latest version of this predictor.
