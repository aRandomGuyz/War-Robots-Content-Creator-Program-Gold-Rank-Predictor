How to use this code and predictor (easy):

1. - For computers, make sure to have VS (Visual Studio) Code installed and make sure it works fine, 
firstly, make a "Text Document" file in anywhere on your files, such as your "Documents" folder.

2. - Rename it to "WR Creator Program Predictor.html", to make full sure that it's a ".html" file type, go to "View" at the top of File Explorer, 
at the bottom of the "View" list, click on "Show" and once a new small list pops up, click on "File name extensions", there if it says ".txt", 
remove that, replace it with ".html", if a window pops up saying "If you change a file name extension, the file might become unusable." 
click "Yes" or press "Enter" on your keyboard.

3. - Head into VS Code, we'll open our text file that we made, you can press Ctrl + O and double click that exact text file in your File Explorer, 
or, on the top left corner, click on "File" > "Open File..." and double click on the exact text file made, you'll then have a clean, empty text file in VS Code.

4. - Paste in the code (right click > "Paste" / Ctrl + V) below into this text file, then make sure to save it by pressing Ctrl + S.

5. - Go back to that ".html" file on File Explorer, then right click/hover on "Open with" > your browser, then you can double click on it later on, 
and it'll open in your browser, and you can use it freely to estimate, enjoy!

  <!-- INFO SECTION -->
  <div class="box info">
    <h3>How you know you have reached Gold</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email Notification [Most Common]</strong> – This is the main and expected way, official confirmation sent to your email attached to the Creator Program, the subject is usually somethign like "Creator Program Rank Update" or "Congratulations on Reaching Gold", the email typically mentions new rank, benefits unlocked, sometimes next expectations, this is the clearest, no-doubt confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboard Rank Update</strong> – Even if email is delayed, the Dashboard rank will still change from Silver to Gold. New rewards/perks become visible. Sometimes stats reset for the new tier. Many creators actually notice this before reading the email. So realistically: Dashboard change = Confirmation / Email = Official Acknowledgement.</li>
      <li><strong>Silent Dashboard Promotion [RARE But Possible]</strong> – It's not common, but it can happen in this form: No immediate email. Dashboard rank changes. Email arrives hours or days later. What doesn't happen: Staying Silver rank visually while secretly being Gold rank. Being promoted without any dashboard indication at all. So: True silent promotion with no dashboard change = Basically no.</li>
      <li><strong>⚠️Important⚠️</strong>: Make SURE to work hard though, upload atleast ~20+ videos (videos, shorts, streams) per period, and make sure they are informative, if you get nearly around ~1,000 or more views, excellent, you're on a good path, keep it up, subscribers are also good but don't matter as much.</li>
    </ul>

      This is an unofficial community-made estimator. Not affiliated at all with Pixonic or MY.GAMES. I, an anonymous Silver rank Creator in the Program since the SWORD Unit-190 event also made this predictor and will be continuously updating it for errors via VS (Visual Studio) Code and releasing it further, even if I make it into Gold rank.
