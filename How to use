How to use this code and predictor (easy):

1. - For computers, make sure to have VS (Visual Studio) Code installed and make sure it works fine, 
firstly, make a "Text Document" file in anywhere on your files, such as your "Documents" folder.

2. - Rename it to "WR Creator Program Predictor.html", to make full sure that it's a ".html" file type, go to "View" at the top of File Explorer, 
at the bottom of the "View" list, click on "Show" and once a new small list pops up, click on "File name extensions", there if it says ".txt", 
remove that, replace it with ".html", if a window pops up saying "If you change a file name extension, the file might become unusable." 
click "Yes" or press "Enter" on your keyboard.

3. - Head into VS Code, we'll open our text file that we made, you can press Ctrl + O and double click that exact text file in your File Explorer, 
or, on the top left corner, click on "File" > "Open File..." and double click on the exact text file made, you'll then have a clean, empty text file in VS Code.

4. - Paste in the code (right click > "Paste" / Ctrl + V) below into this text file, then make sure to save it by pressing Ctrl + S.

5. - Go back to that ".html" file on File Explorer, then right click/hover on "Open with" > your browser, then you can double click on it later on, 
and it'll open in your browser, and you can use it freely to estimate, enjoy!

      <h2>About The Unique Creator:</h2>

      <p>
        I’m an anonymous War Robots Content Creator Program member.
        I am also on Spotify, who makes Phonk and absolutely loves tracks like NEON BLADE 
        by MoonDeity and I make the actual good Phonk like in 2020+, etc, which I do NOT like 
        "Phonks" that are considered that by Spotify when in reality they're Brazilian Funk...
        I got into the Creator Program since the SWORD Unit-190 event, which is 
        update 11.1, which started shortly after our final GCSE exams started (I failed badly), 
        the event started on the day of our Computing exam, and so ever since then I've been 
        regularly trying in the program, trying to get promoted, but nothing ever happened, 
        then once the current event, update 11.6 reached, my favorite themed gear/equipment 
        such as the new Hastatus robot and Princeps titan got released, I was devastated to not 
        get it, which I then told myself "I NEED to work HARDER, and START GRINDING SERIOUSLY!", 
        with that, even though I was doing fairly decent to good, I improved videos, shorts, streams, 
        primarily videos, and their thumbnails, as of right now, it's 2:43 A.M just reached 29th December, in 
        2025, and on the 26th, around ~20:00/8 P.M (UK, London time), is when my good friend made it in Gold rank, 
        how come? Simple, the most probable and likely reason for this is, due to his low stats, Pixonic saw that 
        he "might leave", with JUST under 10 videos, but also ~500+ views, so Pixonic didn't say a word, and 
        promoted him, they conditionally gave him Gold, as from then on, they expect good content from it, good 
        results, which adds pressure, but he gets free stuff, and if not up to Pixonic's expectations, he could 
        get demoted to Silver, but I'm happy for him, for me, I am doing very good right now for my stats, so I get a 
        comfortable Gold rank promotion in the long-run, even if I get a delayed Gold rank promotion, right now, I 
        don't mind not getting promoted right now, but hopefully after the next event (after update 11.7).

      </p>

      <p>
        I originally started as a small Roblox creator, I knew some editing, thumbnails, etc, slowly, 
        I overtime started to go more and more with War Robots content, especially ever since making it 
        into the Creator Program, I focused a lot of my content on WR, I still do Roblox content as a 
        "side-video" but I am mostly now known for being a WR Creator.
      </p>

      <p>
        This predictor was thought of and then built via VS (Visual Studio Code) during my huge improvement 
        from Silver rank to Gold rank, since then, i've been improving it more and more, based on patterns I've 
        seen and from previous patterns, basically on how Pixonic behaves, and so this predictor was first designed 
        to mainly predict when I could make it, but I then decided "Might as well release it publicly to help future 
        Silver rank creators.", and here I am today, so this predictor reflects how promotions actually happen in practice.
